# ✦ Requirements

- Neovim 0.11+
- Git
- A Nerd Font (for icons)
- A terminal with true color support
- Kitty terminal (required for dashboard image support)
- A compositor with transparency support (e.g. Hyprland on Wayland)
- ripgrep (`rg`) for searching
- fd (optional, improves file searching)


### Notes

- This configuration uses transparency. It depends on your terminal and compositor setup (e.g. Kitty + Hyprland). Results may vary.
- Dashboard image support requires Kitty and `3rd/image.nvim`.
- Neovim does not handle transparency directly; it is controlled externally.
- The default theme is Greyscale. Use `<leader>tt` to switch themes.
